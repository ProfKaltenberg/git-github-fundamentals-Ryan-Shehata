My name is Ryan Shehata! I am a graduate student in Pace University's applied quantitative analysis program, and am a data science consulting intern!

I'm excited to learn about R and Python in my ECO 590 course, and am looking forward to getting to know everyone in the class. 

I'm hoping that this class will be a collaborative learning experience for us all, and that we can learn something from each of our projects!
